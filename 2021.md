## Approach

At the beginning I was looking for some sort of logical decryption but did not find anything, therefore I started "guessing". We can see the underscore characters which are probably part of the flag. The sequence before: `😡💯🩸💯 😇🧐 👻😡💯 🤡🤠👌🎅:` kinda looked like `here is the flag`, therefore I started replacing the emojis with the correct letters. Step by step I was able to build following conversion table:

| Emoji | Letter | Emoji  | Letter | Emoji | Letter |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| 😡    | h      | 💯     | e      | 🩸    | r      |
| 😇    | i      | 🧐     | s      | 👻    | t      |
| 🤡    | f      | 🤠     | l      | 👌    | a      |
| 🎅    | g      | 🕵️‍♀️ | c      | 🖖    | y      |
| 😝    | o      | 😂     | u      | 👀    | n      |
| 👍    | w      | 😳     | m      | 😍    | d      |
| 🙈    | b      | 🙊     | v      | 🐣    | k      |
| 🙉    | j      | 🐢     | p      | 🐬    | z (?)  |

This table can be used to convert the text into following:

```
hello there!

you might wonder why there is text before the flag huh?
well, it would be to easy if i gave it to you right away.

do you like emojis? i do, as you can obviously see.
enough now, here is the flag: emojis_are_love_emojis_are_life

i hope you enjoy this years ctf!

greetz!
```

According to the text, our flag for this challenge is:

```
KDCTF{emojis_are_love_emojis_are_life}
```
